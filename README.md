# Local Learn Day: THREE.js

## Guide
Hi there! This repository contains a sample on how to use [THREE.js](https://threejs.org/), a JavaScript library for creating 3D computer graphics in your browser using WebGL.

You can view the (very helpful) documentation for THREE.js [here](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene). If you're experimenting, this documentation is super important for figuring out what kinds of things you can do using THREE.js.

### Preliminary Knowledge
Note that this workshop assumes you have basic (very basic!) knowledge of HTML and (barely) CSS. If you don't, I suggest you review the W3 Schools tutorials for [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) and [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) on your own time, then coming back and reviewing this workshop material.

It also assumes a basic understanding of vanilla Javascript. However, I actually learned Javascript while learning THREE.js so if you don't know JS, it won't be impossible to follow along so long as you have a basic understanding of programming concepts.
